**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   @terichadbourne There’s been some feedback that we should break up the Decentralized Data Structures tutorial into two separate ones to acknowledge that the Merkle tree / DAG pieces are more advanced while basic content addressing, peers, hashing/CIDs, etc. are truly beginner concepts.



**Action Items / Help Wanted**

_Announce issues that need help, get people to help_

-   The application deadline for the first-ever [IPFS Camp](https://camp.ipfs.io/) (Barcelona, June 27-30) has been extended to May 17 (or as soon as space runs out). Don’t forget to mention your ProtoSchool community involvement when you apply!
-   Apply for [Offline Camp](http://offlinefirst.org/camp) (Oregon, August 2-5) by May 17 to save $150. It’s a small tech retreat where we discuss the [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org) approach making tech work in no- or low-bandwidth scenarios. (The event isn’t specifically about dweb, but dweb enthusiasts who are excited about Offline First are welcome!)

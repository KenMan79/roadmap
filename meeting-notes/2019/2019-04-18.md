**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   _While your ProtoSchool tab is open, your data is on the network. Dan would love to see a lesson where you use a community service for pinning but Mikeal says there’s not one that’s unauthenticated now that would work. We will be able to link to something after IPFSCamp because they are building some new content around pinning. While we definitely need to cover the concepts it’s unclear how we would easily pin data on behalf of ProtoSchool users at zero cost._
